# Console-Game-Egine
This is a simple "game engine"
There will be such things as:
- [x] Events (so far, only the lose is implemented)
- [x] Quiz
- [x] RPG
- Text games with maps
- [x] Player Structure Qualities (so far only name, nick, age and native country)

**There aren't 3D Games in the plan :)**
